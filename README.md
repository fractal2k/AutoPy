# Basic Web Automation Project
Automates some tasks in Chrome / Firefox, needs [Gecko Driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) for Mozilla Firefox or [Chrome Driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for Chrome.

**For Chrome**, you will have to edit the `chromedriver` variable to the driver location in your pc.

ps. I recommend using Firefox, because chromedriver **will** act funny in some cases, and the chrome code is made for personal use (it's shit).
